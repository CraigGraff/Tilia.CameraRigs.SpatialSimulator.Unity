# Changelog

### [1.0.1](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator.Unity/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1) (2019-11-06)

#### Bug Fixes

* **structure:** add missing .meta file ([4f6c15c](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator.Unity/commit/4f6c15c795de1592f25c57d272945322e9e4d00d))
  > The CHANGELOG.md file is automatically created by the CI+CD system and therefore does not exist for Unity to create the .meta file for it until the release has occurred.
  > 
  > This fix manually adds in the missing .meta file.

#### Miscellaneous Chores
